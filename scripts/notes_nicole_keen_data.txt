My goal was to merge (most) data at the transect/year level across .csv files provided


Starting files

keen_cover <- this is percent cover data, included in final dataframe
keen_fish <- these are fish counts, included in final dataframe
keen_quads <- these are quadrat count data, I did include these in final dataframe
keen_swath <- these are swath counts, I did include these in final dataframe
kelp_quads_biomass <- these are kelp biomass estimates, I did include these in final dataframe

keen_kelp <- these are kelp morphology data, I did not include these in final dataframe
keen_sites <- these are site data, I did include these in final dataframe yet


General strategy

Clean up and subset data in each file to remove rare species, then reduce to the five main identifiers 
(NETWORK, PI, YEAR, SITE, TRANSECT), some identifier of group (species or substrate, column named ID), 
and some quantative measure (e.g, percent cover, column named QUANTITY)
Note: not all files had MONTH and DAY so didn't include those as identifiers

To the ID column, I appended the source of the data to differentiate between units/species represented multiple files

Data source abbreviations (at end of ID column)

keen_cover <- PERCOV
keen_fish <- FC
kelp_quads_biomass <- KB
keen_quads <- QD
keeN_swath <- SW

NOTE I DROPPED TRANSECTS WITHOUT DATA IN keen_sites WILL FIX THIS LATER

Specific decisions in each starting file

keen_cover 

looks to me like all percent cover estimates are already at the transect level
combined substrate types and species into ID column
removed ~ 10 rows with an undefined species code (as defined in KEEN ONE New England Species List v1.3.4.xlsx)
removed any species groups with <50% percent cover SUMMED OVER THE ENTIRE DATASET

keen_fish

looked like TOAN was meant to be TAON so fixed that
removed young of year then summed remaining size classes

keen_kelp_quads_biomass

aggregated data at transect/year level

keen_quads

removed species with fewer than 10 individuals found in entire dataset
summed species across size classes

keen_swath

aggregated data at transect/year level
removed species with fewer than 10 individuals found in entire dataset
summed species across size classes
